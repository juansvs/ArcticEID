To get a better understanding of how bacterial diseases are spreading across populations of ungulates in the Canadian Arctic, and how they may be impacting these populations, we built a series of epidemiological models. These models represent the demographics and disease transmission processes for two bacteria of interest: *Erysipelothrix rhusiopatiae* (Er) and *Brucella suis* (Bs). Er has caused mass mortality events, which have been documented since 2011. Bs in turn causes abortions, reducing mean fecundity in the population. Given low population growth rates in musk oxen in particular, reductions in fecundity could have significant detrimental impact on these populations.

## Deterministic model

First, we build deterministic models that use a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE). These models follow a SIR(D) structure (D for carcasses on the landscape). The models include demographic—fecundity, natural mortality—and epidemiological processes—acquisition, disease mortality. The diagram below shows a schematic representation of this model applied to *Er* in musk oxen. In this model, susceptible individuals (S) become infected with the bacterium (I) following contact with contaminated carcasses (D), or with infected individuals. Once infected, individuals can either become resistant (R), or develop a pathology and die.

The model is represented by the following ODE system:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt}&=\phi(S+I+R)-\mu_N S-\beta S(D+I)+\lambda R\\
\frac{dI}{dt}&=-\mu_N I +\beta S(D+I)-\theta\mu_I I -(1-\theta)\rho I\\
\frac{dR}{dt}&=-\mu_N R+(1-\theta)\rho I-\lambda R\\
\frac{dD}{dt}&=\theta\mu_I I-\delta D
\end{align}
$$

Parameters are as follows:

### Maternal immunity

There is some evidence that antibodies can be transferred to newborns. We can include this in the model by having the resistant compartment increase through births, rather than resistant individuals contributing to .

\frac{dS}{dt}&=\phi(S+I)-\mu_N S-\beta S(D+I)+\lambda R\\
\frac{dI}{dt}&=-\mu_N I +\beta S(D+I)-\theta\mu_I I -(1-\theta)\rho I\\

Including maternal immunity does not have a large impact on the overall predictions from the model. You still see a large reduction in population size, and a slow recovery followed by a new crash as the density of susceptible individuals increases again.

### Stage structure

To better capture the long-term effects of disease on the population, we can further divide the compartments by stages, so that juveniles cannot reproduce, but can become infected and die. This model also allows to include maternally transferred immunity. The diagram below represents this model. The equations now include a development term $\gamma$ that represents the rate of transition from juvenile to adult. Assuming first reproduction at 3 years of age, the rate of transition is given by $\gamma=1/(1+\mu_J)^3$, where $\mu_J$ is the yearly mortality rate of juveniles (30%?).

The new system of ODE is the following:

\begin{align}
\frac{dS_J}{dt}&=\phi(S_A+I_A)-\gamma S_J-\mu_{J} S_J-\beta S_J(D+I_J+I_A)+\lambda R_J\\
\frac{dI_J}{dt}&=-\mu_{J} I_J-\gamma I_J +\beta S_J(D+I_J+I_A)-\theta\mu_I I_J -(1-\theta)\rho I_J\\
\frac{dR_J}{dt}&=\phi R_A-\mu_{J} R_J+(1-\theta)\rho I_J-\lambda R_J\\
\frac{dS_A}{dt}&=\gamma S_J-\mu_{N} S_A-\beta S_A(D+I_J+I_A)+\lambda R_A\\
\frac{dI_A}{dt}&=\gamma I_J-\mu_{N} I_A+\beta S_A(D+I_J+I_A)-\theta \mu_I I_A-(1-\theta)\rho I_A\\
\frac{dR_A}{dt}&=\gamma R_J-\mu_{N} R_A+(1-\theta)\rho I_A-\lambda R_A\\
\frac{dD}{dt}&=\theta\mu_I (I_A+I_J)-\delta D\\

Including stage structure delays the recovery of the population. This makes sense given that we are including juvenile mortality, which reduces the growth rate of the population.
